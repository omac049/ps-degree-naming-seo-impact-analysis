# Professional Studies Degree Naming: SEO Impact Analysis (v2)

**University of Arizona Global Campus (UAGC)**  
**Report Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0

---

## Hero (What We Need to Decide + What Success Looks Like)

### Objective
Protect and grow **organic discovery and lead generation** as we transition from traditional degree designations (AA/BA/BS/MA/MS) to **Professional Studies** naming (APS/BPS/MPS), including a **90-credit BPS pilot**.

### Decisions Needed (Marketing + SEO + Web + Academics)
1. **URL strategy**: preserve current high-performing URL structures vs introduce new `/bps`/`/mps` URLs (with redirects).
2. **On-page naming standard**: when and how we use “Professional Studies” + degree abbreviations (BPS/APS/MPS) alongside traditional language (Bachelor’s, Master’s).
3. **Content deliverables**: commit to a minimum set of “education + comparison + 90-credit” pages before/at launch.

### Success Criteria (First 90 Days Post-Launch)
- **No sustained organic traffic loss** beyond agreed tolerance on degree/program entry points.
- **No sustained conversion-rate drop** on top degree pages (RFI / key events).
- **Stable indexing + crawl health** (no spikes in 404s, duplicate content, or canonical conflicts).
- **Positive trend** in discovery for “professional studies” + “90-credit bachelor’s” intent terms (measured via GSC impressions/clicks + rankings tool).

---

## Executive Summary

We can make the naming transition an SEO-positive story **if** we treat it as both a **migration** and a **market education** problem. The high-leverage path is to:

1. **Run a dual-language strategy** on-page: pair “Professional Studies” with plain-language degree terms (e.g., “Bachelor’s degree”, “online bachelor’s”) so we don’t rely on unfamiliar abbreviations alone.
2. **Build an education hub + comparison content** (“What is a BPS?” / “BPS vs BA vs BS”) to capture and convert intent we expect during the transition.
3. **Lead with the 90-credit narrative** with an explicit landing page and supporting FAQs, aligned to the broader three-year/accelerated-degree conversation in higher ed.

### Key Findings (What We Can Say With Confidence Today)
- **BPS/MPS naming is established in higher ed**: multiple universities use these designations, and competitor content patterns show how they explain them (see citations).
- **Our highest-risk area is navigational + legacy URL equity**: changing URL structures can create avoidable SEO volatility unless we execute redirects/canonicals/sitemaps cleanly.
- **Education content is a proven organic acquisition model for us**: top organic landing pages include educational blog posts (internal GA4 snapshot below).

### Claims That Require Tooling to Quantify (Do Not Treat as Verified Yet)
- “BA/BS has higher search volume than BPS” and keyword-volume comparisons generally require **Keyword Planner / Ahrefs / SEMrush** (see “Open Research Backlog”).

## Program Naming Overview

### New Degree Designations (As Provided)

| Current | New Designation | Credits | Duration | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|---------|----------|-------|
| AA | APS (Associate of Professional Studies) | 60 | 104 weeks | Pilot program |
| BA/BS | BPS (Bachelor of Professional Studies) | 90 | 156 weeks | 90-credit pilot |
| MA/MS | MPS (Master of Professional Studies) | Current | Current | Aligned to existing structure |

### Recommended On-Page Naming Standard (Dual-Language)

Use a consistent rule across pages:
- **First mention**: spell out + plain language  
  - Example: “Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS) — an online bachelor’s degree…”
- **Subsequent mentions**: abbreviation is allowed when unambiguous  
  - Example: “In this BPS program…”
- **Always include a plain-language anchor** near the top (H1, intro, or first module)  
  - Example: “online bachelor’s degree”, “degree completion”, “working adults”

---

## SEO Strategy (What We’re Actually Going to Do)

### 1) Keyword + Intent Framework (Operational)

We will organize content and reporting by intent, not just by degree abbreviations:

#### Tier A: Program + Enrollment Intent
- “Bachelor of Professional Studies online”
- “BPS degree online”
- “degree completion program”
- “online bachelor’s degree for working adults”

#### Tier B: Education / Definition Intent
- “What is a BPS degree”
- “Bachelor of Professional Studies meaning”
- “Professional studies degree”

#### Tier C: Comparison Intent
- “BPS vs BA”
- “BPS vs BS”
- “Professional studies vs liberal arts”

#### Tier D: Accelerated / 90-credit Intent
- “90 credit bachelor’s degree”
- “three-year bachelor’s degree”
- “accelerated bachelor’s degree”

### 2) SERP Ownership Plan (The Minimum Page Set)

We should publish (or refresh) these pages before/at the naming switch:

1. **BPS hub**: “What is a Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS)?”
2. **Comparison**: “BPS vs BA vs BS (and who each is for)”
3. **90-credit landing**: “90-credit Bachelor of Professional Studies at UAGC”
4. **Program pages**: each program page uses dual-language titles + metadata and links back to (1)–(3).

## SEO Migration Runbook (Execution Checklist)

### Phase 0 — Discovery (2–3 weeks before launch)
- Inventory all impacted URLs (degree hubs, program pages, blog posts, internal search pages).
- Tag “**do not break**” pages: highest organic sessions + conversions (GA4 + GSC).
- Export baseline:
  - GA4: sessions, key events, engagement rate by page
  - GSC: clicks, impressions, CTR, avg position by page/query
  - Crawl: indexable URLs, canonicals, status codes, internal links (Screaming Frog or similar)

### Phase 1 — Build (1–2 weeks before launch)
- Implement naming changes in content + metadata using the dual-language standard.
- Create the Minimum Page Set (BPS hub, comparison, 90-credit landing).
- Add **FAQ sections** where appropriate to support FAQ schema.

### Phase 2 — Launch (Day 0)
Two acceptable paths; pick one and execute cleanly:

#### Option A: Preserve URLs (Preferred for risk reduction)
- Keep existing high-performing URL paths (e.g., `/online-degrees/bachelors/*`) and update:
  - Titles, H1s, intro copy, structured data, internal links
- Benefit: preserves URL equity; lowest technical volatility.

#### Option B: Introduce new `/bps` + `/mps` URLs (Only if we must)
- Create new URLs.
- 301 redirect old → new (one-to-one mapping; avoid chains).
- Update canonicals, sitemaps, internal links, and navigation.
- Add GSC annotations + monitor 404s daily for first 2 weeks.

### Phase 3 — Stabilize (Weeks 1–4)
- Daily checks (first 7–10 days), then weekly:
  - 404/soft-404 spikes
  - Index coverage changes
  - Ranking and traffic deltas on priority pages
  - Conversion rate deltas
- Fix fast:
  - Redirect gaps
  - Canonical mistakes
  - Internal-link stranding

### Phase 4 — Optimize (Weeks 4–12)
- Expand content clusters:
  - “What can you do with a professional studies degree?”
  - “Is a BPS worth it?” (FAQ + outcomes framing)
  - “How the 90-credit bachelor’s works” (admissions + transfer)

## Page Briefs (Copy/SEO Templates We Can Hand to Content)

### Template: BPS Hub Page
- **Working title**: What Is a Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS)?
- **Primary intent**: education/definition + soft conversion
- **Recommended modules**:
  - Definition + who it’s for (working adults, degree completion)
  - How BPS differs from BA/BS (high-level, non-controversial, no unsourced percentages)
  - How long it takes / credit expectations (our program specifics only)
  - FAQs (6–10) + FAQ schema
  - Clear next step CTA to programs
- **Internal links**: to program category hubs + comparison page + 90-credit page

### Template: Comparison Page
- **Working title**: BPS vs BA vs BS: Which Bachelor’s Degree Is Right for You?
- **Primary intent**: comparison + conversion assist
- **Content rules**:
  - Avoid unverifiable “% liberal arts” claims unless we can cite a program/academic policy source per institution.
  - Use “typical differences” language and focus on outcomes + audience fit.

### Template: 90-Credit Landing Page
- **Working title**: 90-Credit Bachelor’s Degree (BPS) at UAGC
- **Primary intent**: accelerated-degree intent + conversion
- **Key modules**:
  - The value proposition (time-to-degree, working adults)

  - How credits map (visual)
  - FAQs + schema
